# Monitoring-K8S-DevOps

This project is a **Flask**-based web application that monitors **system usage** and displays it in a user-friendly interface. The application can be built using **Docker** and deployed on **Kubernetes**, and it can be hosted on the cloud, specifically on **AWS** (Amazon Web Services).

# Introduction

Monitoring system usage is crucial for maintaining the performance and **stability** of applications running on a server. This project provides a Flask web application that collects **system metrics**, such as **CPU usage**, **memory usage**, and **disk usage**, and presents them in a visually appealing and intuitive dashboard. By leveraging Docker and Kubernetes, you can easily deploy and scale this application to meet your needs. Additionally, hosting the application on AWS allows for reliable and scalable infrastructure.
